The project "Responsive Social Media Website With Theme Customization" is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to create a social media-like website with responsive design and the ability to customize the theme.

The website consists of multiple sections, including a sidebar with menu items, a messages section, and a theme customization section. The sidebar allows users to navigate through different sections of the website, and it highlights the active menu item.

The messages section displays chat messages, and it includes a search functionality that allows users to search for specific chats. The messages section also has a notification feature that highlights the tab and temporarily adds a box shadow effect when clicked.

The theme customization section enables users to customize the website's theme. It provides options to change font sizes and primary colors. Users can select different font sizes, and the website's text will adjust accordingly. They can also choose from a range of primary colors, which will update the website's color scheme.
